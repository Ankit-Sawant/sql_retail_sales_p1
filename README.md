# Retail Sales Analysis with SQL
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL, where I first performed data cleaning and then answered various business questions related to sales performance, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns. This analysis provides insights into sales trends and customer behavior over specific periods and categories.
